      A cancer risk factor is anything that increases a person's likelihood of developing cancer. Risk factors can include lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and poor diet, as well as genetic and environmental factors. Identifying and addressing risk factors through policy and programmes and behaviour changes can reduce the risk of developing cancer.

Addressing the risk factors for cancer offer a cost-effective and long-term strategy for cancer control. In recognition of this, WHO recommends that “national policies and programmes should be implemented to raise awareness, to reduce exposure to cancer risk factors and to ensure that people are provided with the information and support they need to adopt healthy lifestyles.

You can reduce your risk of cancer by making healthy lifestyle choices, such as eating well, exercising regularly, and avoiding tobacco. You can also protect yourself from the sun, get vaccinated, and get regular cancer screenings.
