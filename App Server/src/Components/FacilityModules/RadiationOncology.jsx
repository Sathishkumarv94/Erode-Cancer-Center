          Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is an advanced technique in cancer care that delivers
          high-precision radiation using computer-controlled machines, tailored to the shape and size of the tumor.

            <h3>How IMRT Works</h3>
            <p>
              IMRT uses multiple beam angles with varying intensities to focus radiation on tumors while sparing
              surrounding healthy tissues. This allows us to deliver higher doses where needed without harming nearby organs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Treatment plans are designed with advanced imaging and planning software, ensuring optimal precision and safety.

          <h3>Key Benefits of IMRT</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Customized radiation dose delivery</li>
            <li>Minimized exposure to healthy tissues</li>
            <li>Reduced treatment-related side effects</li>
            <li>Effective for complex and hard-to-reach tumors</li>

          <h3>Who Can Benefit?</h3>
          <p>
            IMRT is ideal for treating cancers located near sensitive areas such as the brain, spine, prostate, head and neck,
            and gynecologic regions. Itâ€™s especially useful when traditional radiation would risk damaging critical organs.

          <h3>Advanced Imaging & Planning</h3>
          <p>
            Every IMRT treatment begins with high-resolution imaging to map the tumor's exact location. Our planning software
            then develops a customized plan, balancing maximum tumor control with minimal side effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            This process ensures accuracy and consistency throughout your treatment journey.
